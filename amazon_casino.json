Case in point.  During my bonus spin sessions in Wild West, most all of them always will payout to within $5.00 of $1249.00. Almost every bonus spin, when it does retrigger, will do so for the maximum 150 free spins. Definitely not random.  On the other hand, you have a better chance of maintaining a supply of phony money without having to buy any or wait for the free regen every three or four hours in this app. Another thing that proves preprogrammed outcomes is the fact that the three jackpot icons have never come up in over 40 bonus games and yet each item in the bonus game has the exact same number of icons (3). Of the 15 subgames in the House of Fun, my two favorites are Africa and Wild West.Update. Shortly after I first created this review, my payouts radically changed, leading me to believe that they are continually muddling with this app.  On another note, I hit the 1,000,000 dollar jackpot, but after my bonus spin was completed, they did not award it to my funds.

Unfortunately that's not the case. I hope this saves many the money and disappointment i have faced. Because if you contact the game they will tell you it's a matter of luck yet the other 7 casino games I play have much better coin packages, bonuses and playback. So why is this game so different?

It is ridiculous that the minimum amount of coins that I can purchase is in the amount of $7.99... and that is only for 48000 coins. They could very easily add two more packages under $7.99! They also need to increase the amount of coins in their packages. I would play House of Fun more often if they fixed this issue.

You WILL eventually lose your money/chips. Now you need to know that this statement is the complete opposite of an insult to this app. Go to any casino in the world and play slots all day. You could play all day on your bank roll and end up a big winner. BUT if you continued to play on that bank roll you will eventually lose it all. Odds are never in your favor in a casino. Do you think they look that fantastic and employee so many people by losing money?But in the end it is what makes this app the most realistic and enjoyable and relatable to playing in a casino. It is also not like every other casino slot app that lets you win for the first day and cheat you for every spin after that. It is definitely random and you will have your good days and bad days.

I also count spins between bonus and 99% of the time I have to spin 500-800 spins and the bonus isn't that good. And it's not giving much in playback wins either. You might have a good hit rarely but by than its cost you dearly. The games are fun and the graphics are great. If the payouts, bonuses and purchases were better it would be my favorite casino game. Unfortunately that's not the case. I hope this saves many the money and disappointment i have faced. Because if you contact the game they will tell you it's a matter of luck yet the other 7 casino games I play have much better coin packages, bonuses and playback. So why is this game so different? There is no monetary payout so the least it could do is entertain us for a while. I have purchased the $99 coin package for anywhere between $750,000-1,000,000 and never hit one bonus most the time. My bet is between $750-$4,500. Which is a low bet for that balance compared to the other games I play. It has taken my purchases within minutes too many times to count.

I'm now at level 28 and the slots are really very tight now. The freebies are far less though you are encouraged to bet more in order to have any chance of winning.
